# AsteropeScripts
READ THE FULL README FILE FIRST!!!
These are the launch and landing scripts for Asterope. You are free to use them and experiment with them. Go, Download these and show your creativity!
You need Kerbal Operating System (kOS) for running these.
It is advised to use them on reusable rockets. But you can also use them on other, two staged vehicles.
Remember to set these Action Groups:
AG1 for toggling engine mode
Update:! AG2 is now not required to be set up, as strongback is now retracted by SRT manually at T-2:00 min.
AG7 for toggling Soot texture on the tank.
